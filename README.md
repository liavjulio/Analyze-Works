# Analyze Works Repository

This repository contains a series of Python scripts developed for analyzing various assignments. Each script serves a specific purpose in the analysis process and can be used individually depending on the requirements of the assignment.

## Files Overview

### `work1.py`
This script focuses on matrix operations, including:
- **Minor Calculation**: Computes the minor of a matrix by excluding specific rows and columns.
- **Determinant Calculation**: Recursively calculates the determinant of a square matrix.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Performs multiplication between two matrices.
- **Inverse Matrix Calculation**: Finds the inverse of a 3x3 matrix using elementary row operations.

### `work2.py`
This script focuses on solving systems of linear equations using methods like:
- **Gaussian Elimination**: Solves a system of linear equations by transforming the matrix into an upper triangular form.
- **Back Substitution**: Solves for the unknown variables after Gaussian elimination.
- **Cramer's Rule**: Uses determinants to solve a system of linear equations.

### `work3.py`
This script includes functions related to statistical analysis, such as:
- **Mean and Variance Calculation**: Computes the mean and variance of a dataset.
- **Z-score Normalization**: Normalizes data based on z-scores.
- **Linear Regression**: Performs linear regression analysis on a dataset.

### `work4.py`
This script handles interpolation methods, including:
- **Linear Interpolation**: Computes the interpolated value between two points.
- **Polynomial Interpolation**: Uses polynomial fitting to interpolate a value based on three points.
- **Lagrange Interpolation**: Implements Lagrange interpolation for a set of three points to approximate a value.
